# Neverending Legacy Mods

I've been experimenting with modding Orteil's lesser known game [Neverending Legacy](https://orteil.dashnet.org/legacy/). I highly recommend having a look at the game, even though it's quite bare-bones at the moment and can easily be completed in less than a day.

## Fauna
The plan is:

* Add tameable horses and livestock to the game
* Add vegetarianism, veganism and carnivorism traits
* Add technologies so horses can be used to speed up some activites such as expedition and scouting
* Add technologies to create new food and resources from livestock such as milk and wool

## Installation Guide
Open [Legacy](https://orteil.dashnet.org/legacy/) in your browser and, when creating a new tribe, click 'Use Mods' in the top right-hand corner.

Below data.js, paste in the following URL:

Click 'Load Mods' and start the game as normal. The mod should be installed!
